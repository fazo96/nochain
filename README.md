# NoChain

NoChain is a password manager that never stores any data at all but can still keep all of your passwords.

- works on every web browser
- works offline, because it's fully static
- all its dependencies are included, so that it will never stop working
- doesn't remember anything at all, to make it easy to be safer and not to leave any trace
- is focused on simplicity and openness both in user interface and underlying code and systems

### Safety Disclaimer

I am not a cryptography expert. This is still a prototype-y university student project. It's probably not that safe, but I guess it's better than using the same password for multiple services.

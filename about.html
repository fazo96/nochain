        <h2>NoChain</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> generates a different password for each service you need
          <li> works offline, in any browser
          <li> lightweight, it should load fast on slow networks
          <li> responsive, works well on small screens
          <li> private, it doesn't log anything, send anything or store anything anywhere
          <li> standalone, you can download the page and use it even if your machine is offline
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> even though all of this is true, remember that <u>your browser</u> probably saves this page in its history or this website may be compromised and logging your keystrokes.</p>
